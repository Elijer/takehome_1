# Mongoose Lab
I created this repo to explore a coding challenge I was given by a potential employer. That challenge can be found in `docs/challenge.md`.

Contents:
- index.ts
- getTableData.ts: a map lookup function to solve Q1 of the challenge
- getTableDataAgg.ts: a MongoDB aggregation experiment I wrote to compare the performance of MongoDB aggregations against the map lookup.
- sample_seed_data/ seed data that I've saved to use later
- seeder.ts: used to seed mongoDB data for testing
